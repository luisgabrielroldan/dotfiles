This is a Bash script that uses BorgBackup to create and prune backups. It
checks for required configuration variables and excludes specific files and
directories from the backup. The script prompts for a password if not defined
and creates a backup with progress and statistics options. Finally, the script
prunes the repository according to a specified retention policy.

There are three external Bash variables used in this script:

  BORG_REPOSITORY     The path to the BorgBackup repository. It can be a local
                      directory or a remote server.

  BORG_BACKUP_PREFIX  A prefix for the backup archive's name. It defaults to
                      the username and hostname if not defined.

  BORG_PASSPHRASE     The passphrase used to encrypt the backup. If not defined,
                      the script will prompt the user to enter it.

Options:
  -h, --help          Display this help and exit.
