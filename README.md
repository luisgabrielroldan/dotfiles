# My Dotfiles

I have created this set of tools for personal use, so I have not provided
detailed instructions for others to install and use it. However, I have decided
to make it publicly available in case someone finds it helpful or inspiring.
Keep in mind that this may not be the best way to configure things, but it has
been practical for my personal needs. Hopefully, it can provide some inspiration
to those who are looking to create their own customized development environment.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luisgabrielroldan/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

## Contributing

Feel free to use these dotfiles as a starting point for your own configuration.
If you find any issues or have any suggestions, please open an issue or submit a
pull request.
